#Bluetooth Research Project

The end game of this research is to examine the effects that different signals have on brains.  For the experiment, lab rats will have their brains connected to small bluetooth transmitters that will read data from their brain waves.  This project aims to create a Bluetooth application that is capable of connecting to multiple transmitters and have the ability to send data almost simoulatneously to them.  After the data is sent, the transmitters will send Data back based on the brain wave activity of the mice.

The applications for this research are pretty limitless but suffice to say that the field of Neuroscience would stand to greatly benefit from this data.

The research is headed by Professor Jae-Woong Jeong who is an Assistant Professor in Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering; Materials Science and Engineering. And here is a link to the paper explaining this technology.
